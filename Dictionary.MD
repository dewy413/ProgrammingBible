Algorithm
: A set of instructions used to solve a problem.

Structured Design
: Dividing a problem into smaller subproblems.
: This process lead to a concept called **structured programming**

Objected-oriented Design
: First step is to identify components which are called objects. They form together to create the basis of the solution.
: This leads to **object-oriented programming**. 

Instance
: An input to an algorithm.

Float
: Represents any real number. Allows for four bytes of data.

Double
: Represents any real number. Allows for eight bytes of data.

Pseudocode
: Mixture of natural language and programming language.

Time Efficiency
: How fast the algorithm runs.

Space Efficiency
: How much extra memory the algorithm uses.
