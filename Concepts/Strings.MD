# scanf() || printf()
- Int ("%d"): 32 Bit integer
- Long ("%ld"): 64 bit integer
- Char ("%c"): Character type
- Float ("%f"): 32 bit real value
- Double ("%lf"): 64 bit real value


scanf can have many parameters to it, but the idea of it is that you can use these special characters to determine what type you will get out of the input.

`scanf("format_specifier", &val)`

<sub>*Note: If you are taking in a lot of numbers printf and scanf are faster.*</sub>
